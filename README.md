### WhY iS iT cAlLeD mOvIeLo

This is the third iteration of this project. The goal was always to make a better movie rating system/service. It's called **movielo**, because I had just watched *The Social Network* and wanted to use an ELO rating system.

`movie + elo = movielo`

That turned out to be dumb.

The new system is inspired by my own movie rating spreadsheet. Not all movies can be rated on the same scale/system and everyone has a different idea of what is important when rating movies. Thus, a customizable system with inputs you can edit like columns of a spreadsheet is my answer.

The name stuck though.
